## How to Contribute

If you have a new Registrar implementation, bug fix, or other general improvement FiftyThree's Open Source team would be glad to review and consider your contribution. This document provides details on the process, conventions, and mechanics for becoming a contributor to the Bubo library.

## Getting Started

To get started developing for Bubo you should follow these steps:
 1. Fork the GitHub repository and clone to your computer.
 2. Setup [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html).
 3. Open a commandline of your choice and cd into the root Bubo directory.
 4. Run a full build `./gradlew build` which will also run the unit tests.
 5. If #4 is successful then you can create a jar file by running `./gradlew jar`
